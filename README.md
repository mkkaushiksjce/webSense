# webSense
Now no complicated code required for creating a build system. Just use webSense, it knows about web developemnt since built for web by web developers.

## Why another build system ??
* I hate writting complicated codes for my build systems. Webpack is awesome but difficult.

## Do we need to write a config file ?
* Yup but this time no complicated code, just a webSense.json

## Dude are you serious ? Modern Web development is scary ?
* JS was originally developed to be simple but powerful. So let's keep things simple, let's just create a json file. We will handle the complicated code for you. (I know js developers are awesome !!!)
